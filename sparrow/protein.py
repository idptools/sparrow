        User-facing high-performance implementation for generic calculation of
        kappa_x. We use this for calculating real kappa (where group1 and
        group2 are ['E','D'] and ['R','K'], respectively but the function can
        be used to calculate arbitrary kappa-based patterning.

        NB1: kappa will return as -1 if

        1. the sequece is shorter than the windowsize
        2. There are no residues from either group1 or group2

        The function will raise an exception if the windowsize is < 2

        NB2: kappa is defined as comparing the ratio of delta with deltamax,
        where *in this implementation* deltamax refers to the delta associated
        with the most segregated sequece; e.g::

            (AAA)n-(XXX)m-(BBB)p

        Sometimes, when the charge asymmetry is VERY highly skewed, this most
        highly segregated sequence does not give the highest delta value, such
        that we can get a kappa greater than 1. This only occurs in situations
        where kappa is probably not a useful metric anyway (i.e 100x excess of
        one group residue vs. another). We recommend setting the 'flatten'
        keyword to True, which means kappa values over 1 will be flatteed to 1.

        NB3: this implementation differs very slightly from the canonical
        kappa reference implementation; it adds non-contributing 'wings' of
        the windowsize onto the N- and C-termini of the sequence. This
        means residue clusters at the end contribute to the overall sequence
        patterning as much as those in the middle, and also ensures we can
        analytically determine the deltamax sequence for arbitrary
        windowsizes.

        This both addresses a previous (subtle) limitation in kappa, but also
        buys a ~100x speedup compared to previous reference implementations.
        As a final note, I (Alex) wrote the original reference implementation
        in localCIDER, so feel comfortable criticising it's flaws!

        NB4: If no residues are provided in group2 then the function assumes
        all residues not defined in group1 are in group2 and the function
        becomes a binary patterning function instead of a ternary pattering
        function.

        Parameters
        -------------
        group1 : str
            Must be a string of valid amino acid one letter codes.
            This defines one set of residues for which patterning
            is computed against. If a second set is not provided,
            patterning is done via group1 vs. all other residues.

        group2 : str
            If provided, this defines the SECOND set of residues,
            such that patterning is done as residues in group1 vs.
            group2 in the background of everything else.

        window_size : int
            The window size used for the computation of kappa, by default 6

        window_size : int
            Size over which local sequence patterning will be
            calculated. Default = 6.

        flatten : bool
            Flag which, if set to True, means if kappa is above 1 the
            function will flatten the value to 1. Default = True.

        Returns
        -------------
        float
            Returns a value associated with the generalized kappa. If
            flatten is True this is guarenteed to be between 0 and 1
            unless it's -1 (see above). If flatten is set to False its
            VERY likeli this will be between 0 and 1 and if it's above
            1 the parameter is probably not useful to use.

            List of positions (indexing from 1 onwards) which will be bolded. Useful for highlighting specific regions. Note that this
            defines individual residues so (for example) to bold residues 10 to 15 would require bold_positions=[10,11,12,13,14,15].
            Default is an empty list.

        bold_residues : list
            List of residue types that can be bolded. Useful for highlighting specific residue groups.  Default is an empty list.

        opaque_positions : list
            List of positions (indexing from 1 onwards) which will be grey and slighlty opaque. Useful for highlighting specific regions.
            Note that this defines individual residues so (for example) to bold residues 10 to 15 would require
            bold_positions=[10,11,12,13,14,15]. Default is an empty list.

        return_raw_string : bool
            If set to true, the function returns the actual raw HTML string, as opposed to an in-notebook rendering.
            Default is False

        warnings : bool
            If set to True, will print warnings if an invalid amino acid is encountered. Default is True.

        Returns
        ----------
        None or str
            If return_raw_string is set to True then an HTML-compatible string is returned.


        Raises
        -------
        sparrow.sparrow_exceptions.SparrowException
            Raises a sparrow exception if invalid input is provided (within reason).
